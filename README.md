### Running native code in Java
Uses JNI to call a library that implements code that runs on the native platform.

Based on http://mrjoelkemp.com/2012/01/getting-started-with-jni-and-c-on-osx-lion/.

The above example starts with the Java class that contains a method declared to be
a native interface to the platform. The example then uses a Java command line tool
to generate a C++ header that declares the method signature that needs to be
implemented in C++. The C++ code was then added followed by compiling and linking
the code to create the `.jnilib`.


### Building the Simplified Project
    $ ./build.sh


### Running the Simplified Project
    $ java HelloWorld

should print the following to standard out: `Oh JNI, how cumbersome you are!`
